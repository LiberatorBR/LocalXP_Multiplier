# LocalXP_Multiplier
This is a C++ program specifically made for Final Fantasy VII for me to stay ahead of the grind. 
I also plan to repurpose this for Persona 5 at some point.
I coded and complied this in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 if anyone was interested.

If anyone wants to help to make this better or more clean, go right ahead and I'll merge any changes that I approv of.
